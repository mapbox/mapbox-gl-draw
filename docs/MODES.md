# Creating modes for Mapbox Draw

In Mapbox Draw, modes are used to group sets of user interactions into one behavior. Internally Draw has the `draw_polygon` mode, which controls a bunch of interactions for drawing a polygon. Draw also has the `simple_select` mode which controls interactions when zero, one or many features are selected including transitioning to `direct_select` mode when a user's interactions imply that they want to do detailed edits of a single feature.

To help developers have more control of their Mapbox Draw powered application, Draw provides an interface for writing and hooking in custom modes. Below we will see how to write these modes by working through a small example.

## Writing Custom Modes

We're going to create a custom mode called `LotsOfPointsMode`. When active, this mode will create a new point each time a user clicks on the map and will transition to the default mode when the user hits the esc key.

```js
var LotsOfPointsMode = {};

// When the mode starts this function will be called.
// The `opts` argument comes from `draw.changeMode('lotsofpoints', {count:7})`.
// The value returned should be an object and will be passed to all other lifecycle functions
LotsOfPointsMode.onSetup = function(opts) {
  var state = {};
  state.count = opts.count || 0;
  return state;
};

// Whenever a user clicks on the map, Draw will call `onClick`
LotsOfPointsMode.onClick = function(state, e) {
  // `this.newFeature` takes geojson and makes a DrawFeature
  var point = this.newFeature({
    type: 'Feature',
    properties: {
      count: state.count
    },
    geometry: {
      type: 'Point',
      coordinates: [e.lngLat.lng, e.lngLat.lat]
    }
  });
  this.addFeature(point); // puts the point on the map
};

// Whenever a user clicks on a key while focused on the map, it will be sent here
LotsOfPointsMode.onKeyUp = function(state, e) {
  if (e.keyCode === 27) return this.changeMode('simple_select');
};

// This is the only required function for a mode.
// It decides which features currently in Draw's data store will be rendered on the map.
// All features passed to `display` will be rendered, so you can pass multiple display features per internal feature.
// See `styling-draw` in `API.md` for advice on making display features
LotsOfPointsMode.toDisplayFeatures = function(state, geojson, display) {
  display(geojson);
};

// Add the new draw mode to the MapboxDraw object
var draw = new MapboxDraw({
  defaultMode: 'lots_of_points',
  // Adds the LotsOfPointsMode to the built-in set of modes
  modes: Object.assign({
    lots_of_points: LotsOfPointsMode,
  }, MapboxDraw.modes),
});
```
